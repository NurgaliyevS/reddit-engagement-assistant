# Reddit Engagement Helper (Non-Commercial Research Tool)

This project is a small external tool designed to help Reddit users improve the quality, clarity, and rule-compliance of their posts **before** submitting them to Reddit.  
It uses **only public Reddit data** and follows Reddit’s Responsible Builder Policy.

---

## 🚀 Purpose of the Tool

The tool helps Redditors:

- Understand subreddit rules and posting guidelines  
- Avoid creating duplicate or repetitive posts  
- Format titles and content in ways that match subreddit norms  
- See examples of high-performing post structures  
- Reduce accidental rule violations  
- Improve content quality and clarity before publishing  

This ultimately leads to:

- Better user experience  
- Less spam  
- Fewer low-effort submissions  
- Reduced moderator workload  
- More engagement-friendly posts

## 🔒 What the Tool **Does NOT** Do

To comply fully with Reddit rules, the tool:

❌ Does NOT automate posting  
❌ Does NOT comment, vote, message, or perform actions on behalf of a user  
❌ Does NOT act as a bot inside subreddits  
❌ Does NOT scrape or store large datasets  
❌ Does NOT infer sensitive user attributes  
❌ Does NOT train machine learning models on Reddit data  
❌ Does NOT bypass API rate limits  

This tool is **100% non-commercial** and used only for lightweight research and content-quality assistance.

## 🛠️ Technical Overview

- Built as an **external application**, not a Devvit app  
- Uses Reddit’s official OAuth-based API  
- Retrieves only **public subreddit metadata** and **recent posts**  
- Processes data in real time without long-term storage  
- Provides suggestions via a minimal dashboard or output interface  

---

## 📌 Why Devvit Cannot Support This Project

Devvit is focused on **in-Reddit apps**, moderation tools, and subreddit-internal functionality.

This project requires:

- External analysis  
- Cross-subreddit pattern detection  
- Pre-submission quality checks  
- A standalone dashboard outside Reddit’s UI  

Because the tool works **before** users interact with Reddit, it cannot be built inside Devvit’s ecosystem, which is why external API access is required.
